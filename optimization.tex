COMPILER OPTIMIZATION CONCEPTS: 

1. Compiler typically does optimizations locally and then proceeds to globally optimize the smaller code sections. 

2. Common Code Paths: It is beneficial if the compiler can determine which code path the program execution does most in. It can optimize that path to be fast which can result in overall increase performance. 

3. Branching Techniques: to prevent misprediction of branching, we can use loop unrolling, inlining, and branch prediction hints.
