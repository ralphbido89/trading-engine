Design: 

Threading Model - Market data Publisher and Order Gateway Server will be independent threads. This is intentional so both can operate independently.

1. Build Threads, Set Affinity on them, assign tasks for each threads
2. Communication between Threads - Lock-free queue. Lock-free FIFO queue.
